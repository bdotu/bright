Cognitive biases are systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, and are often studied in psychology and behavioral economics.[1]

Although the reality of these biases is confirmed by replicable research,[2][3] there are often controversies about how to classify these biases or how to explain them.[4] Some are effects of information-processing rules (i.e., mental shortcuts), called heuristics, that the brain uses to produce decisions or judgments. Biases have a variety of forms and appear as cognitive ("cold") bias, such as mental noise,[5] or motivational ("hot") bias, such as when beliefs are distorted by wishful thinking. Both effects can be present at the same time.[6][7]

There are also controversies over some of these biases as to whether they count as useless or irrational, or whether they result in useful attitudes or behavior. For example, when getting to know others, people tend to ask leading questions which seem biased towards confirming their assumptions about the person. However, this kind of confirmation bias has also been argued to be an example of social skill: a way to establish a connection with the other person.[8]

Although this research overwhelmingly involves human subjects, some findings that demonstrate bias have been found in non-human animals as well. For example, hyperbolic discounting has been observed in rats, pigeons, and monkeys.[9]

Decision-making, belief, and behavioral biases

Many of these biases affect belief formation, business and economic decisions, and human behavior in general.

Name	Description
Ambiguity effect	The tendency to avoid options for which the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown.[10]
Anchoring or focalism	The tendency to rely too heavily, or "anchor", on one trait or piece of information when making decisions (usually the first piece of information acquired on that subject).[11][12]
Anthropocentric thinking	The tendency to use human analogies as a basis for reasoning about other, less familiar, biological phenomena.[13]
Anthropomorphism or personification	The tendency to characterize animals, objects, and abstract concepts as possessing human-like traits, emotions, and intentions.[14]
Attentional bias	The tendency of perception to be affected by recurring thoughts.[15]
Automation bias	The tendency to depend excessively on automated systems which can lead to erroneous automated information overriding correct decisions.[16]
Availability heuristic	The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of events with greater "availability" in memory, which can be influenced by how recent the memories are or how unusual or emotionally charged they may be.[17]
Availability cascade	A self-reinforcing process in which a collective belief gains more and more plausibility through its increasing repetition in public discourse (or "repeat something long enough and it will become true").[18]
Backfire effect	The reaction to disconfirming evidence by strengthening one's previous beliefs.[19] cf. Continued influence effect.
Bandwagon effect	The tendency to do (or believe) things because many other people do (or believe) the same. Related to groupthink and herd behavior.[20]
Base rate fallacy or Base rate neglect	The tendency to ignore base rate information (generic, general information) and focus on specific information (information only pertaining to a certain case).[21]
Belief bias	An effect where someone's evaluation of the logical strength of an argument is biased by the believability of the conclusion.[22]
Ben Franklin effect	A person who has performed a favor for someone is more likely to do another favor for that person than they would be if they had received a favor from that person.[23]
Berkson's paradox	The tendency to misinterpret statistical experiments involving conditional probabilities.[24]
Bias blind spot	The tendency to see oneself as less biased than other people, or to be able to identify more cognitive biases in others than in oneself.[25]
Choice-supportive bias	The tendency to remember one's choices as better than they actually were.[26]
Clustering illusion	The tendency to overestimate the importance of small runs, streaks, or clusters in large samples of random data (that is, seeing phantom patterns).[12]
Confirmation bias	The tendency to search for, interpret, focus on and remember information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.[27]
Congruence bias	The tendency to test hypotheses exclusively through direct testing, instead of testing possible alternative hypotheses.[12]
Conjunction fallacy	The tendency to assume that specific conditions are more probable than general ones.[28]
Conservatism (belief revision)	The tendency to revise one's belief insufficiently when presented with new evidence.[5][29][30]
Continued influence effect	The tendency to believe previously learned misinformation even after it has been corrected. Misinformation can still influence inferences one generates after a correction has occurred.[31] cf. Backfire effect
Contrast effect	The enhancement or reduction of a certain stimulus' perception when compared with a recently observed, contrasting object.[32]
Courtesy bias	The tendency to give an opinion that is more socially correct than one's true opinion, so as to avoid offending anyone.[33]
Curse of knowledge	When better-informed people find it extremely difficult to think about problems from the perspective of lesser-informed people.[34]
Declinism	The predisposition to view the past favorably (rosy retrospection) and future negatively.[35]
Decoy effect	Preferences for either option A or B change in favor of option B when option C is presented, which is completely dominated by option B (inferior in all respects) and partially dominated by option A.[36]
Default effect	When given a choice between several options, the tendency to favor the default one.[37]
Denomination effect	The tendency to spend more money when it is denominated in small amounts (e.g., coins) rather than large amounts (e.g., bills).[38]
Disposition effect	The tendency to sell an asset that has accumulated in value and resist selling an asset that has declined in value.[39]
Distinction bias	The tendency to view two options as more dissimilar when evaluating them simultaneously than when evaluating them separately.[40]
Dread aversion	Just as losses yield double the emotional impact of gains, dread yields double the emotional impact of savouring.[41]
Dunning–Kruger effect	The tendency for unskilled individuals to overestimate their own ability and the tendency for experts to underestimate their own ability.[42]
Duration neglect	The neglect of the duration of an episode in determining its value.[43]
Empathy gap	The tendency to underestimate the influence or strength of feelings, in either oneself or others.[44]
Endowment effect	The tendency for people to demand much more to give up an object than they would be willing to pay to acquire it.[45]
Exaggerated expectation	The tendency to expect or predict more extreme outcomes than those outcomes that actually happen.[5]
Experimenter's or expectation bias	The tendency for experimenters to believe, certify, and publish data that agree with their expectations for the outcome of an experiment, and to disbelieve, discard, or downgrade the corresponding weightings for data that appear to conflict with those expectations.[46]
Focusing effect	The tendency to place too much importance on one aspect of an event.[47]
Forer effect or Barnum effect	The observation that individuals will give high accuracy ratings to descriptions of their personality that supposedly are tailored specifically for them, but are in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people. This effect can provide a partial explanation for the widespread acceptance of some beliefs and practices, such as astrology, fortune telling, graphology, and some types of personality tests.[48]
Form function attribution bias	In human–robot interaction, the tendency of people to make systematic errors when interacting with a robot. People may base their expectations and perceptions of a robot on its appearance (form) and attribute functions which do not necessarily mirror the true functions of the robot.[49]
Framing effect	Drawing different conclusions from the same information, depending on how that information is presented.[50]
Frequency illusion or Baader–Meinhof effect	The illusion in which a word, a name, or other thing that has recently come to one's attention suddenly seems to appear with improbable frequency shortly afterwards (not to be confused with the recency illusion or selection bias).[51] This illusion is sometimes referred to as the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon.[52]
Functional fixedness	Limits a person to using an object only in the way it is traditionally used.[53]
Gambler's fallacy	The tendency to think that future probabilities are altered by past events, when in reality they are unchanged. The fallacy arises from an erroneous conceptualization of the law of large numbers. For example, "I've flipped heads with this coin five times consecutively, so the chance of tails coming out on the sixth flip is much greater than heads."[54]
